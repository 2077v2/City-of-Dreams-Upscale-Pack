Always double-check Vortex to make sure it uninstalled/installed something properly during an update. If you are having any issues with crashing or mods not loading you can do the following.

1) Purge mods in Vortex

2) Go to where cyberpunk2077 is installed and delete these 4 folders / bin / engine / r6 / red4ext

3) Go to the following location and delete the **"mod"** folder. If you don't see it that's fine.

- **GOG>**     *Drive Letter:\Games\Cyberpunk 2077*\archive\pc\mod 
- **Steam>**  *Drive Letter:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Cyberpunk 2077*\archive\pc\mod
- **Epic>**      *Drive Letter:\Epic Games\Cyberpunk 2077*\archive\pc\mod
